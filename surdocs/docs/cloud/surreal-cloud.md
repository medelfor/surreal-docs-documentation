# Surreal Cloud vs other hosting platforms

When documentation is ready, a question about where to host it arises. Two main paths you may take here are to host generated HTML in a 3rd party hosting platform or to host the documentation in Surreal Cloud - a hosting platform developed by Medelfor specifically for Surreal Docs. This table details benefits you gain when hosting documentation generated with Surreal Docs in Surreal Cloud instead of other hosting platforms. It compares different limitations you can face when using other hosting providers, available support and simplicity of documentation deployment (or lack thereof).
