# Licensing

Any individual or an organization that uses Surreal Docs to generate
documentation for a project related to cryptocurrency, NFTs or
blockchain is obliged to buy a "Crypto" license since the
[Surreal Docs EULA](https://medelfor.com/eula/surreal-docs
"Surreal Docs EULA") does not allow usage free of charge
in crypto-projects.

Any organization which uses Surreal Docs and has the last year revenue bigger
than US $100,000 is obliged to buy a "XL" license since the aforementioned EULA does not allow free usage
by such companies.

You can acquire a license in our [Store](https://store.medelfor.com/
"Medelfor Store"). Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Note that a free version has several limitations compared to the paid one.
Compare different versions [here](https://medelfor.com/products/surreal-docs#pricing "Different Surreal Docs versions").
