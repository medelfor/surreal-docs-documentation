# Installation and requirements

The latest version of Surreal Docs is `1.0.1-preview`

We publish installers of new Surreal Docs versions on the "Releases" page in 
[our GitHub](https://github.com/medelfor/surreal-docs/releases/ "Releases").

To install Surreal Docs please download the latest installer from the "Releases" page and run it. Note, that in order to work correctly Surreal Docs requires NodeJS (at least 10.18.1) to be installed with `npm` being available in the `PATH` environment variable. If no NodeJS is already installed on your system, Surreal Docs Installer will install an appropriate version (18.16.0) automatically.

You can check whether the `npm` and NodeJS are available by running the following commands:
```
npm --version
```
and
```
node --version
```

``note
title: Visual Studio
Note also that in order to work Surreal Docs requires Microsoft Visual Studio to be installed on your machine.

For instructions on how to install Visual Studio to use it with Unreal Engine, please refer to [this page](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine/ "Installation of Visual Studio") of the Epic Games' documentation.
