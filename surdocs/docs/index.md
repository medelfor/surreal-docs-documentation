# Welcome to Surreal Docs

![Surreal Docs Banner](images/SurrealDocsBanner.png)

Surreal Docs is a comprehensive documentation generation system designed specifically for Unreal Engine-powered projects. It generates documentation for both C++ and Blueprint API references, and provides users with the ability to create custom pages using a feature-rich dialect of Markdown. Additionally, Surreal Docs seamlessly integrates with Surreal Cloud, our online documentation hosting platform, allowing users to easily share their documentation with others. Finally, Surreal Docs has a deep understanding of all UE-specific C++ features and Blueprints, what allows it to cleverly interweave C++ and BP entities in the resulting documentation.

This documentation is generated by Surreal Docs and hosted by Surreal Cloud.
