# Welcome to Surreal Docs

![Surreal Docs Banner](images/SurrealDocsBanner.png)

Surreal Docs is the first all-encompassing docs generation system for
Unreal Engine-powered projects. It generates documentation for Unreal Engine
projects, C++ and Blueprint API references in particular. 
It enables user to create their own custom pages using a feature-rich dialect of Markdown.
Surreal Docs seamlessly integrates with our online docs hosting - Surreal Cloud, 
making it easy to share the docs publicly, privately with a team or within an organization.
Finally Surreal Docs perfectly understands all UE-specific C++ features, Blueprints and
easily interweaves corresponding C++ and Blueprint entities in the resulting documentation!

This documentation is generated by Surreal Docs as well.
